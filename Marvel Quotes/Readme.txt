This code creates a HashMap that contains key-value pairs of hero or villain names and their quotes from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 
The code then creates a variable named "heroOrVillain" and assigns it the value "Iron Man". The code then uses the get() method from the HashMap to retrieve 
the value (quote) associated with the key (heroOrVillain) and prints it to the console. This allows the user to input a specific hero or villain name and have the
code output a quote associated with that character. This can be useful for creating a trivia game or for displaying quotes on a website or application.
